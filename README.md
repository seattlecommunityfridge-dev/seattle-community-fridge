The official website for the **Seattle Community Fridge**, found here: (https://seattlecommunityfridge.org/). We are a mutual aid group that provides refrigerators and pantries in the city of Seattle in order to combat food insecurity. This site aims to help users find the food they need by guiding them to fridges, and provide resources and details to those that want to volunteer and help.

We acknowledge that we reside on the unceded territories of the Duwamish and other Coast Salish peoples and thank them for the privilege.
