            <h1>About SEATTLE COMMUNITY FRIDGE</h1>
            <p className="text-black text-xl w-2/3 mx-auto my-8">
                Seattle Community Fridge is a mutual aid group founded in 2020, 
                in response to the urgent food insecurity needs engendered by the COVID pandemic. 
                It soon became apparent, however, that there were many hungry people 
                in need of the services we provided. 
                We have built and maintained sheltered fridges and pantries throughout 
                the greater Seattle area since then.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black text-xl w-2/3 mx-auto my-8">
                We are run entirely by uncompensated community volunteers. 
                We work toward food justice for all people by providing places to donate food, currently at five locations. 
                Each site consists of a refrigerator and pantry; these are located outdoors and available at all times. 
                We also strive to curb food waste by gleaning and distributing food from stores, restaurants, 
                and other businesses that would otherwise have thrown it away. 
                We use some monetary donations to purchase shelf-stable foods and encourage community members 
                to help stock the refrigerators and pantries. 
                As possible, we provide other necessities such as toiletries, hand warmers, warm clothing, 
                water, water bottles, and menstrual products.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black text-xl w-2/3 mx-auto my-8">
                SCF is made up of community members and operates non-hierarchically with group consensus 
                for ideas and decision-making. We have no overhead beyond storage, and no staff; 
                all of us are community members just like you and the people we serve. 
                All our efforts and the donations we receive are dedicated to ensuring that our neighbors are fed.
            </p>

                We do not collect or share the information of those who access the refrigerators 
                or donate to the organization, except as needed for essential volunteer activities. 
                All food and other necessities are freely available to all, without restriction, 
                judgment, or access control.

                <p className="text-black text-xl w-2/3 mx-auto my-8">
                    Mutual aid is solidarity, not charity.  <span className="font-bold">Everyone looks out for one another,</span> gives what they can, and takes what they need.
                    Mutual aid is a <span className="font-bold">community-led solution</span> for meeting those needs and filling the gaps. Mutual Aid acknowledges the fact that well-intentioned charity work can often 
                    lead to paternalism and exacerbation of the inequities underlying poverty and hunger. It actively seeks to avoid this trap.
